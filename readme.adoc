== The fabulous DIY walking robot kit.

_tl;dr: Build your own walking robot._

Welcome to the Bakiwiverse.

Bakiwis are small walking robots with only two motors that come as a kit and are easy to build. Each Bakiwi is unique. You can freely choose how it will look and behave. You can easily change your Bakiwi's walking style with four knobs mounted on the printed circuit board. Programming is not required, but have a look into the _source_ folder if you like to modify the firmware and add some nice features.

Bakiwis combine education and fun and are therefore perfect for teaching robotics to children and beginners. We have already built dozens of Bakiwis in many workshops and the builders are always amazed when their robot creature starts to walk. While it is fun to build and play with the bakiwis, many skills and technical experience are acquired.
